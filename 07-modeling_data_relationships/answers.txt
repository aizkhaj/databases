1. Hotel database queries (see hotel_database.sql for schema):

- Find a guest who exists in the database and has not booked a room.
    SELECT guests.name, bookings.id AS booking_id
    FROM guests
    FULL OUTER JOIN bookings ON bookings.guest_id = guests.id
    WHERE bookings.id IS NULL;

    name 	booking_id
    Woody 	(null)

- Find bookings for a guest who has booked two rooms for the same dates.
    SELECT guests.name, ARRAY_AGG(bookings.room_number) AS room_numbers, bookings.check_in_date
    FROM bookings
    JOIN guests ON guests.id = bookings.guest_id
    GROUP BY guests.name, bookings.check_in_date
    HAVING COUNT(bookings.room_number) > 1;

    name 	room_numbers 	check_in_date
    Andy 	104,105 	    2018-01-19

- Find bookings for a guest who has booked one room several times on different dates.
    SELECT guests.name, ARRAY_AGG(bookings.check_in_date) AS check_in_dates, bookings.room_number
    FROM bookings
    JOIN guests ON guests.id = bookings.guest_id
    GROUP BY guests.name, bookings.room_number
    HAVING COUNT(bookings.check_in_date) > 1;

    name 	    check_in_dates 	        room_number
    Deadpool 	2018-01-20,2018-01-29 	101

- Count the number of unique guests who have booked the same room.
    SELECT COUNT(guests.id) AS count_unique_guest_id, bookings.room_number
    FROM bookings
    JOIN guests ON guests.id = bookings.guest_id
    GROUP BY bookings.room_number
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT guests.id) > 1;

    count_unique_guest_id 	room_number
    2 	                    104

    JOIN classes ON classes.class_id = enrollments.class_id
    WHERE classes.subject_name = 'math'
    GROUP BY enrollments.grades, classes.subject_name
    ORDER BY enrollments.grades ASC;

    grades 	grades_per_class 	subject_name
    A 	    2 	              math
